                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>Skill Ocean is a platform for people from all ages to explore more than just school studies. 
                    The platform encourages users to exchange their skills and strengths with each other to learn new things from one another. 
                </p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Lots of online learning platforms are rising nowadays, but one of the major disadvantage is 
                    that users cannot interact with real people in real time. 
                    We wanted to solve these problems by making a platforms for all users to be teachers and 
                    exchange their skills for things that they want to learn from other people. 
                    Within the circle, users not only can save money from buying expensive online courses but 
                    also have the opportunity to learn things from the best in the fields.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>1. Help users find their learning partners easily and correctly suits their learning needs.<br>
                    2. Personalize learning experience.<br>
                    3. Easy to use for all ages and all learning fields.</p>

                <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
                <p>We made a user survey to understand more about our potential users and the problems they may have.
                    About 50 responses were recorded. And based on the responses, we concluded our insights.
                </p>


                <h2>Quantitative Research</h2>
                <p>1. Most of our potential users are willing to interact with others and are also willing to learn new things of their own accord. <br>
                    2. Some of them already have some self-taughted experiences, including participating in study clubs, using online learning platforms and watching free tutorials. <br>
                    3. The survey confirmed that most of the users are expecting to have a mobile app that could make their learning processes much more convenient.
                </p>

                <h2>Interviews</h2>
                <p>In order to get a solid understanding of how our potential users are thinking, we conducted 4 face-to-face interview with them.
                    <br> Our interviewees are college students, aging from 21 years old to 25 years old. All of them have some online learning experiences but they all used different platforms.
                    <br> We found that all of them are really willing to try out skill exchanging because it is free. At the same time, we also found out that although they are all really outgoing, they still care about the 
                    people they are going to meet up with, they are concerned that whether their partners can really teach them the skills they want to learn and they can get along or not. </p>


                <h2 id="sketches">Define</h2>
                <p> We created personas to understand more about the user's problems, and we sumed up our design inspirations. <br>
                    We also did a card-sorting interview with our interviewees, to see whether our design fits their expectation.</p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>We settled our ecosystem to learn more about the domain,  task flows to align design decisions with user's behavior, 
                    and information architecture to understand the domain and IA which forms the basis for the app.</p>

                <h2 id="prototype">Branding</h2>
                <p>To make our platform more appealing, a suitavle brand is definitely a must. 
                    We believe that the brand should be friendly for users since we want them to feel comfortable; at the same time,
                    the brand represent a connection via knowledges, so we think the brand should also look professtional.

                </p>

                <h2 id="usertesting">Prototype</h2>
                <p>I developed a click-through prototype on Figma to conduct usability tests.
                    We mapped out a user testing plan, designed several tasks in the prototype, observed users completing
                    the tasks through screen sharing on zoom,
                    and asked for feedback at the end. We received good and surprising reactions and also some areas of
                    improvement which I later implements into the final design.
                    I really enjoyed talking to users, showing them the new design, and seeing their reactions. It
                    motivates me to make thoughtful design decisions that benefit my users.</p>

                <!-- <h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
                <p>1. Improve responsiveness on mobile and tablet <br>
                    2. Design empty states to be more intriguing <br>
                    3. Implement further customizations </p> -->

                <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
                <p>The project helped me dig into the process of design thinking framework and work with different roles in a project. 
                    I designed most of the UI, so I learned how to implement design guidelines and develop a user-friendly application.
                    Moreover, since this is my first time cooperating with a team to do a UI/UX project, I think the most critical thing I've learned is 
                    the importance of delivering ideas clearly to avoid misunderstandings and being effective. Or else the processes may take 
                    too long and leave us no time to revise.
                </p>
