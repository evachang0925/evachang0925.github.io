                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>Skill Ocean is a platform for people from all ages to explore more than just school studies. 
                    The platform encourages users to exchange their skills and strengths with each other to learn new things from one another. 
                </p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Lots of online learning platforms are rising nowadays, but one of the major disadvantage is 
                    that users cannot interact with real people in real time. 
                    We wanted to solve these problems by making a platforms for all users to be teachers and 
                    exchange their skills for things that they want to learn from other people. 
                    Within the circle, users not only can save money from buying expensive online courses but 
                    also have the opportunity to learn things from the best in the fields.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>1. Help users find their learning partners easily and correctly suits their learning needs.<br>
                    2. Personalize learning experience.<br>
                    3. Easy to use for all ages and all learning fields.</p>

                <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
                <p>I first sent out two separated survey on the platform to tutors and learners to understand what's
                    important to them.I received 184 survey responses and conducted five user interviews.</p>


                <h2>Findings about tutors</h2>
                <p>1. Tutors rarely use "my profile" because they don't find them useful. <br>
                    2. Tutors have a hard time navigating on "my session" page to filter hosting vs attending sessions.
                    <br>
                    3. The most frequently used features are host a new session, see session requests, andview feedback.
                </p>

                <h2>Findings about learners</h2>
                <p>1. Learners rarely use "my profile" because they don't find it helpful. <br>
                    2. Learners want to get recommendations on sessions to attend.<br>
                    3. Learners most likely to browse upcoming sessions when they log in to Schoolhouse.<br>
                    4. The most frequently use features are to explore and view “my session”.<br>
                    5. The process of joining a session isn't easy.</p>

                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>I looked at some competitives' dashboard to find inspirations. What I tookaway were <br>
                    1. Using modular blocks to present pieces of information on the homepage can best utilize the
                    space<br>
                    2. Having a left menu helps with navigating through different information <br>
                    3. Grouping quick links in one place and using icons to prioritize them </p>

                <h2 id="usertesting">User Testing</h2>
                <p>I developed a click-through prototype on Figma to conduct usability tests to get an in-depth
                    understanding of
                    how users interact with the new interface. I did 40 tests in total during two weeks with existing
                    users (both tutors and learners.)
                    I mapped out a user testing plan, designed several tasks in the prototype, observed users completing
                    the tasks through screen sharing on zoom,
                    and asked for feedback at the end. I received good and surprising reactions and also some areas of
                    improvement which I later implements into the final design.
                    I really enjoyed talking to users, showing them the new design, and seeing their reactions. It
                    motivates me to make thoughtful design decisions that benefit my users.</p>


                <h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
                <p>1. Improve responsiveness on mobile and tablet <br>
                    2. Design empty states to be more intriguing <br>
                    3. Implement further customizations </p>

                <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
                <p>I'm proud to work on such a large-scale project from the very beginning. Thanks a lot to my team for
                    believing me and supporting me throughout the process. I learned to collaborate with engineers and
                    hand off final deliverables. I challenged myself to think of a lot of iterations, present them to my
                    manager, and test with users. I took advantage of our volunteer community to ask for feedback
                    proactively. I'm glad to see the dashboard was launched at the end of my internship. If there was
                    one thing I could've done to improve is to onboard existing and new users to the NEW dashboard
                    better. If I have more time, I would continue to gather user feedback and make improvements on v2.
                </p>
