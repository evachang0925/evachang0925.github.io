                <h1  id="top">01. Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    Modern families face challenges shaped by diverse socioeconomic, cultural, and educational backgrounds and varied family structures. 
                    Parents often juggle busy schedules while striving to nurture meaningful connections, 
                    and teenagers navigate emotional shifts as they look for greater independence. The communication barriers can leave 
                    both parents and teens feeling misunderstood. Our team is looking to explore ways to help untangle this feeling.

                </p>
                <p>
                    To address these challenges, we've designed a game that creates a safe space for families to open up. 
                    "In My Shoes" empowers parents and teens to strengthen their relationships through empathy, active listening, and perspective-taking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is designed for parents and teens aged 16-19 who feel misunderstood and want to deepen their 
                    emotional connections. <b>Our goal is to equip parents and teens with skills to better empathize with and understand 
                    each other through gameplay that encourages perspective-taking.</b>
                </p>


                <h1  id="research">02. Our Game</h1>
                
                <p>
                    "In My Shoes" blends imaginative adventures with moments of reflection and connection. 
                    Through engaging gameplay, families step into one another's shoes, experiencing unique perspectives and deepening 
                    their understanding of each other.
                </p>
                <h2>Game Highlights</h2>
                    <ul class="list">

                    <li><b>Pick a Goal Deck:</b> 
                        Choose your family adventure, whether it's a thrilling Family Heist, a daring Trip to Mars, or a strategic battle in the Royal Court.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Choose Your Character:</b> 
                        Take on a unique role with special abilities, along with a secret goal to achieve in the game.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Play & Guess:</b> 
                        Draw a scenario card and rank the responses. Others guess your preferences and reveal insights about each other.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Score Points:</b> 
                        Use skills, achieve secret goals, and match rankings to win!

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game fosters empathy and connection by creating a low-stakes environment for families to explore communication habits without judgment. Its conversational prompts are designed to encourage expression and reflection without directly addressing sensitive topics, minimizing reactance. 
                        Family members naturally start conversations by discussing the answer choices, and thus foster a deeper understanding. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Our Persuasive Design Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                        We've incorporated several persuasive methods into the game to ensure its effectiveness:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> <b>Intermixing:</b> Weaving on-topic and off-topic content to reduce reactance and make on-topic content feel more approachable and digestible.</li>
                        <li> <b>Obfuscation:</b> Concealing the true intent of the persuasive intervention to reduce intimidation and keep users engaged in the activity.</li>
                        <li> <b>Distancing:</b> Using fictionalization and hyperbole to create distance between the user and the content to help them explore it in a way that feels safe to them.</li>
                    </ol>

                <!-- <h1 id="reflection">04. Outcomes</h1>
                <p>
                    This project is truly a rewarding journey for me. As a one-and-a-half year long project, the team had a chance to came up with everything from stretch, and got our hands on the researching, designing, and developing stages. It was such a fulfilling experience to see our vision come to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My biggest takeaways are that about effective communication and how to work as a team in a bigger time length.<br>
                    <ol>
                    <li> <b>Effective Communication:</b> The project stressed the need for clear communication within the team. At first, my UI design was misunderstood by the programmer, showing the importance of giving clear explanations and having detailed talks to make sure everyone understands. This experience improved my communication skills and ability to explain design choices clearly.</li>
                    <li> <b>Teamwork and Collaboration:</b> The project greatly improved my teamwork skills. Working well with team members was essential for solving problems and reaching our goals. Since we had to work together as a team for a while, we spent sometime making some team working ground rules so that we are able to transit our work between one another smoothly , without interfere one another. Also, the project won third place in our graduation capstone competition, showing me the value of working together and supporting each other to achieve a common vision.</li>
                    </ol>
