# My personal website
### Works, About me, and Resume
I decided to make a personal website to have a space to show my past and future projects.ðŸ˜Ž
The web page design and the small animation on the homepage are all designed by myself.ðŸ˜Š
It took me about a week from stratch to this fancy webpage you are now looking at. There still may be some small changes in the future. 
I had a lot of fun making this on my own!

And really thanks to the turtorial video by Bedimcode. I learned a lot.ðŸ™Œ
