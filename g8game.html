                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>G8 planet is a 3D shooting third-person game based on Unity 3D and game art design with Blender.
                    G8 is a Taiwanese slang that stands for unbearable or crappy things. 
                    <br>We created this game to help college students to take a break from the villians in their lives -- 
                    unlikeable vegetables, poor teammates, and the pandemic of course!
                </p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>This is a course project from "3D Game Design", where I teamed up with my members and worked together.
                    During classes, we learned and formed some basic understanding of game programming. I was in charge of most of the 
                    programming work since I was more familiar at coding than my members. They were responsible for the art design and 
                    they built the 3D models of the scenes and characters from scratch. We cooperatd with each other and 
                    finish the project pretty well. 
                </p>

               


                <h2 id="research">Ideation</h2>
                <p>We spent quite some time thinking about how our game will work and what should it be about. 
                    We want people who plays with it feel the same way as what we design and find joy in it.
                </p>


                <h2>A Shooting Game!</h2>
                <p>
                    When we were chatting, we talked about how we dealed with all the crappy things that happened to us all the time.
                    It seemed like we just have to dealed with it, no matter how upset or how mad we were. Sharing similar experiences, 
                    we believe that maybe many people have similar problems, too. We thought that maybe we could make a game to help people let off the steam. <br>
                    A shooting game is just the perfect kind to help us deal with the bad emotions!
                </p>

                


                <h2 id="sketches">Start to work!</h2>
                <p> We created the character, villians, and developed the rules of our game.</p>

                <h2>Character and Background Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Before I got into coding the game, I drew the draft of our main characters. 
                    <br>We wanted the players to customize according to their will. So,we created three standard characters but also allowed the users to mix it up as they want.
                </p>
                <img class="fit" src="assets/img/project/g8-draft.png" alt="charater draft">
                <p>
                    My teammates who were good at making 3D models with Blender built out the characters.The results were so great! We definitely like them a lot!
                </p>
                <img class="fit" src="assets/img/project/g8-char.png" alt="character final">
                <p>
                    We wanted our three stages to be all different. We discussed about what bothers us a lot these days and want to defeat them
                    by the game. <br>We decided that the first stage would be the vegetable that we all hate - bitter squash.
                    <br>The second stage would be about all the sloppy group members that we've met during university.
                    <br>And last but not least, the final stage will be the Covid-19 that changed our lives through out these years.

                <h2>Game System Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the rules was really hard too. We wanted the game to be approachable even for those who
                    do not play video games a lot. But at the same time, we also wanted the game to be adventurous.

                <h2 id="prototype">Final Game Demo</h2>
                <p>
                    During the class final presentation, we played the game with other classmates.<br>They found the game really adorable 
                    and relaxing. The feedbacks from the professor and the TAs were positive, too. We were really satisfied with what we done.
                </p>

                <p>1. Improve responsiveness on mobile and tablet <br>
                    2. Design empty states to be more intriguing <br>
                    3. Implement further customizations </p> -->

                    Developing a game was so fun and so exciting! I enjoys watching the game gradually coming out in shape,
                    with coding, designing, model building and testing it out! It was such a great experience. I hope I will 
                    be able to create more adventurous video games in the future!
